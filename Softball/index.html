  	  <p> What: I really clicked with the sport and just found a lot of interest and fun with it.</p>
	  <p> When: Really when I was little was when I started playing and in the last couple of years I've gotten a lot more serious about the sport.</p>
	  <p> Where: I've played all over with so many different teams. I've played in little leagues, rec leagues, and now my high school team. 
		  I've practiced all over but the furthest I've ever played is either Arizona or St.George. </p>
